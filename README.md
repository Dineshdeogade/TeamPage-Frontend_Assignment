In a lot of websites, you’ll find a Meet the Team page where the company showcases the core team members along with their role and a short bio or description. You’ll be creating a very basic styled version of the same.


Before we actually go into the specifics of it I would like to introduce you to wireframes.
Wireframes are designs which give us an idea of what to build, without going into the exact implementation details. They will generally be given to you by a designer to implement. You can read more about wireframes in this article [also given on the Crio FE-1 Website]

Given below is a wireframe of each team member card.
You’ll need to follow the checklist below to create the above page. 
Checklist
Create an HTML page with the usual declarations
Define CSS internally (inline CSS not recommended)
Use semantic tags like header and section to define parts of your HTML code.
Add a title = “Meet the team” to the page.
The page body should be “snow” in color.
Add a header with the following elements
A main heading saying “Meet the team” with the class as “main-heading”
A subtext under the heading saying - “Meet the people who make this software awesome”. Use the class “main-subtitle” to style this text
Use the following styles
Heading should be indigo in color.
The paragraph should be gray in color.
Add three sections (corresponding to three team members) with class = ‘team-member’ and id equals the name of the member in lowercase. Example if the members name is “Vivek Nigam” the id of their section should be “vivek”.
Each element of the ‘team-member’ class should have the following children.
An image of width and height 100 with alt text as the member’s name. This shall serve as the avatar of the person.
An h2 heading to display the name
An h3 heading to display the role
A paragraph text to display the bio.
The styles for each section of the class ‘team-member’ will be different and are provided in Appendix.
Refer to the wireframe above and the References section for expected results.
